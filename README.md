### *Disclaimer:*  This project is from Stanford's 256A course at CCRMA.  I did not know anything about programming here, I leave this repo up because the demo and track in the [Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeAAXAgaKII) are pretty cool. -Walker 10/27/18

This interactive audio-visual program places the user at the top of spherical globe.  The ring around the globe reacts to the left audio buffer.  The moons have their own dimensions/orbits, it sometimes looks like they move around the user's planet, but I don't think this is really the case.


## Controls
* click and drag to naviage around the globe
* speak, play music, tap your laptop speakers to see the audio buffer send data to the planet's ring

## Potential Improvements/things I do not know how to do
* successfully implement fft to give a range of audio-reactive features
* orbit moons around planet
* hide ring and moons when they move behind the planet
