This interactive audio-visual program places the user at the top of spherical globe.  The ring around the globe reacts to the left audio buffer.  The moons have their own dimensions/orbits, it sometimes looks like they move around the user's planet, but I don't think this is really the case.


##Controls
-click and drag to naviage around the globe
-speak, play music, tap your laptop speakers to see the audio buffer send data to the planet's ring

##Potential Improvements/things I do not know how to do
-successfully implement fft to give a range of audio-reactive features
-orbit moons around planet
-hide ring and moons when they move behind the planet
